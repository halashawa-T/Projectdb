🚀 VPS Deployment

This project was deployed to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) using Back4App.
Back4App provides a managed VPS environment where Docker is pre-installed
and container execution is handled automatically.

The Dockerized project from Assignment #2 was uploaded to Back4App and
deployed using the platform’s container-based workflow, without requiring
manual installation of Git or Docker through a terminal.

The application runs inside Docker containers and is exposed publicly
through the URL provided by Back4App.
